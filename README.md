# Computer Vision Masterclass - Style Transfer

Based on the [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer?hl=en) and the [Style Transfer paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et al.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Style Transfer algorithm, where the style of one image is transferred to another while retaining the content of the target image. This technique is a part of the Computer Vision Masterclass series.
